## 🐦 Twitter / X Post

**Hook**:
Stop wasting 4 hours configuring your frontend.
I built the "Ferrari Engine" for React apps so you don't have to.

**Body**:
Introducing Modern Frontend Starter 🚀
Included:
✅ React 19 + Vite + TypeScript (Strict)
✅ Tailwind + Dark Mode (Zero FOUC)
✅ Pre-configured CI/CD + Tests
✅ Library-grade Components (Button, Input, Dialog)

It’s opinionated, clean, and ready for production.

## 💼 LinkedIn Post

**Headline**:
Why do we rewrite the same boilerplate for every new project?

**Body**:
I got tired of setting up ESLint, Prettier, Tailwind, and Testing libraries every time I started a new idea. So I built the ultimate baseline.

Introducing **Modern Frontend Starter**.

It’s not just a "Hello World". It’s a production-grade engine including:

- **Architecture**: Scalable `src/app` kernel.
- **Components**: Accessible UI primitives (Radix + Tailwind).
- **Safety**: Fail-fast config validation.
- **DX**: VS Code settings, Aliases, and Type Safety baked in.

Ideally, you clone this and delete the splash page within 60 seconds. Then you just build your product.

## 🍊 Hacker News "Show HN"

**Title**: Show HN: Modern Frontend Starter – A strict, production-grade React boilerplate

**Text**:
Hi HN,
I got tired of "starter kits" that were either too simple (just create-vite) or too complex (databases, auth, ORMs pre-installed).

I built **Modern Frontend Starter** to be the "Engine" in the middle.
It focuses on Developer Experience and correct architecture:

- React 19 / Vite / TS / Tailwind
- Strict Directory Structure (`src/app`, `src/lib`, `src/components`)
- Real components (Input, Dialog, etc.) not just demos
- Fail-fast configuration (throws if envs are missing)
- Zero-bloat (designed to be stripped down)

Would love to roast my architecture decisions!
