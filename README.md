## ❓ Why This Starter Exists

- **Too many starters are broken**: Missing types, broken linting, or abandoned.
- **Too many are bloated**: You spend 3 hours removing an auth library you didn't ask for.
- **Opinionated but flexible**: We give you a "Ferrari Engine" (Architecture, Config, Theming) and let you fix the paint.

## 🎯 Who This Is For

- **Beginners**: Learn how a senior engineer structures a project.
- **Indie Hackers**: Skip the setup. Build the product.
- **Teams**: A shared, strict baseline for every new frontend micro-app.

## 🛠 What’s Included (The Engine)

- **Strict Architecture**: `src/app` kernel, `src/lib` config, `src/components/ui`.
- **Fail-Fast Config**: App won't start if env vars are missing.
- **Theme System**: Dark/Light mode, CSS variables, FOUC prevention.
- **Component Engines**: Typed `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, `Dialog` (Radix UI).
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library + User Event.
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier.

## 🧘 Project Philosophy

1.  **Clean**: No dead code. No hidden magic.
2.  **Scalable**: "Files by feature" is tempting, but "Layers by responsibility" scales better for starters.
3.  **Boring**: We use standard tools (Vite, React Router, Tailwind) so you don't have to relearn the wheel.
