## ❓ Why This Starter Exists

Most starter kits fall into two traps:

1.  **Too Simple**: Just a "Hello World" that leaves you to set up routing, testing, and linting yourself.
2.  **Too Bloated**: Includes Auth0, Prisma, Docker, and 15 other things you have to delete.

**Modern Frontend Starter is the "Engine".**
It provides the solid, production-grade foundation (Architecture, TypeScript, Tailwind, Testing) without the product decisions. It is **opinionated about code quality**, but **agnostic about your product**.

## 🛠 What’s Included

- **Strict Architecture**: `src/app` kernel, `src/lib` config, `src/components/ui`.
- **Fail-Fast Config**: App won't start if required env vars are missing.
- **Theme System**: Dark/Light mode, CSS variables, Zero-FOUC.
- **Component Engine**: Typed `Button`, `Input`, `Badge`, `Dialog` (Radix UI).
- **Testing**: Vitest + Testing Library + User Event.
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier.

## 🎯 Who Is This For?

- **Beginners**: Learn how senior engineers structure scalable React applications.
- **Intermediate Devs**: Skip the 4 hours of setup and get straight to building.
- **Advanced Devs**: A reliable, strict baseline for your next SaaS or internal tool.

## 🧘 Project Philosophy

- **Clean**: No dead code. No hidden magic.
- **Scalable**: "Layers by responsibility" architecture that grows with your app.
- **Boring**: We use standard, proven tools (Vite, React Router, Tailwind). Innovative products, boring stack.
